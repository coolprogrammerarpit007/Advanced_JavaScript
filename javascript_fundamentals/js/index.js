// JavaScript Engine
// Javascript engine written in c++

// Interpreters and Compilers
// Interpretor:- takes the codes, parses the code and executes line by line.
// Compiler :- Takes the whole code, converts into machine code then this machine code is sent to cpu which executes that machine code to run the program.

// Babel:- babel is a javascript compiler that takes your modern javascript code and returns browser compatible older JS code.
// Typescript is a superset of javascript that compiles down to javascript.

// Inside the V8 Engine

// 1. Interpretor takes little time to up and running where as compiler takes all the time while doing calculation then upto runnning.
// 2. Compiler does code optimization which produces faster code result after startoff where as Interpretor results slow code because it not provide any code optimizations.

// so to optimize and using for advantages of both the Interpretor and the compiler, browsers started using JIT(JUST IN TIME) Compilers
